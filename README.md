# Text_Adventure

This was a test to see whether or not I could apply Python coding knowledge to create a short text-based adventure with multiple choices and branching pathways.
Story was written while coding was applied and is unfinished, but there are parts where the story was meant to change depending on the choices that were made.
This was written several months ago, and I had very little understanding of classes at the time, which no doubt would make this code much easier on the eyes and lead to less repitition. 
I was also experimenting with having multiple documents and how they may be used between each other.
I plan to rewrite this using better techniques to not only make the code more readable, but to also extend upon this in the future.
